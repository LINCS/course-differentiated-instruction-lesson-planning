        <title>What the Research Suggests</title>
        <content>&lt;h1&gt;What the Research Suggests&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The expanding field of brain research offers new knowledge that seems to support the concept of DI. Researchers Tomlinson and Sousa (2011) state that, ”Recent discoveries regarding how the brain learns substantially support the components of differentiation” (p. 13). New technologies, including functional MRIs (magnetic resonance imaging), have traced the locations of varying brain activities. Additional research shows that environments – positive or negative – affect the brain’s biochemistry and, hence, its ability to learn. For example, asking a student for an answer she doesn’t know or expecting performance on a task that is too difficult can be perceived as threatening, negative and stressful. In such an environment, the brain stimulates hormones that raise anxiety levels, which produces responses aimed at mere survival, not learning. Conversely, in a positive, supportive environment, the brain stimulates a different set of hormones that leave it free to address new information, associating novel stimuli with neural pleasure centers, and responding with improved focus, memory and motivation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not to say that learning should always be comfortable. Indeed, according to a concept called the “zone of proximal development” (ZPD) (Vygotsky, 1978; Tomlinson &amp;amp; Sousa, 2011), which has been used for many decades in teaching reading, maximum learning is achieved when tasks are a little bit beyond a student’s reach. If a student has the appropriate support to help her achieve that task, she is more likely to undertake it and succeed in learning. Tasks that are too easy may be seen as boring; those that are too difficult may be seen as threatening. Both reactions can interfere with learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of ZPD, which is different for every student, compounds the difficult reality of most adult education classes. In some, students are placed according to assessment results while in others they are not; rolling admissions policies can mean they come and go unpredictably. Students represent a wide variety of ages, educational backgrounds, ethnicities and native languages. They face many real-life issues that compete with their academic goals, and their time in the classroom is limited. For all of these reasons, then, readiness is the prime factor among students when attempting to differentiate learning in adult education classrooms. A student’s interests and learning profile – which are much more evident in the sustained time of the K-12 classroom – are secondary factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Readiness must not be seen as synonymous with ability, however. According to Tomlinson and Sousa (2011), readiness represents “an individual’s proximity to, or proficiency with, a specific set of knowledge, understanding and skills designated as essential to a particular segment of study” (p. 85). A student’s knowledge, understanding, and skills may not be the same in math as in writing, say; speaking about the student’s “ability” won’t help us understand how best to teach him. Use of ZPD in selecting reading materials refers to levels as “independent,” which the student can grasp easily, leading to little or no learning, and “instructional,” or beyond a student’s reach without support and scaffolding. The same idea can be applied in other subject areas and is precisely, according to the concept of ZPD, where the best learning will occur.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

        <title>What the Research Suggests (continued)</title>
        <content>&lt;p&gt;Clearly, if teachers are to provide the appropriate level of challenge for every student, differentiation will be essential. At the same time, teachers cannot be expected to provide separate and distinct lessons for each student in a class. Rather, in an effectively differentiated class, students will all be working on the same subjects, principles, and skills, but at levels appropriate to their different levels of readiness. Three elements of DI instruction are key in lesson planning:  learning objectives, assessment, and tiered lessons. Each of these will be elaborated upon in the upcoming course modules, but a brief introduction is in order here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Learning objectives&lt;/b&gt; are what hold a differentiated lesson together. They state precisely what all students should know and be able to do at the end of a lesson or unit. They must be specific, observable, and measurable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Assessment&lt;/b&gt; is threefold. Pre-assessment helps show what students already know and are able to do before the lesson. Ongoing, formative assessment during the lesson demonstrates whether it is effective for students and guides any needed instructional adaptation. Final, summative assessment measures student products, which may be differentiated, to determine whether students have met the learning objectives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tiered lessons&lt;/b&gt; are one way, although not the only way, to provide learning activities that are appropriate for different levels of student readiness. They may differ in content (materials used) or process (type of activity) as well as complexity (depth of understanding). Based on ranges of readiness – for instance, beginning, competent, or advanced – they address these levels without the necessity of completely individualized instruction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An essential partner in the process of producing differentiated lessons is the concept of “backward design,” articulated by Grant Wiggins and Jay McTighe in &lt;i&gt;Understanding by Design&lt;/i&gt; (Wiggins &amp;amp; McTighe, 2005). This method of lesson planning begins with the end, or the final learning, in mind. In stage 1, teachers produce learning objectives that state what students are to have learned or be able to do by the end of the lesson. In stage 2, a crucial reversal of standard lesson planning, teachers decide on assessment, or the means by which they will determine whether students have learned what was intended. Finally, in stage 3, teachers design the learning activities or tiered or otherwise differentiated lessons to be used during the lesson, through which students will do the learning.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;h2&gt;Review&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this module, we have discussed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;differentiated instruction as a means of ensuring that each student learns as deeply and rapidly as possible&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;readiness as a student’s proficiency in specific areas of knowledge, understanding and skills&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the key DI elements of learning objectives, assessment and tiered activities&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the process of backward design in lesson planning, beginning with learning objectives, continuing with designing assessment, and concluding with planning learning activities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Why Should I Use DI?</title>
        <content>&lt;h2&gt;Why Should I Use DI?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teachers of adult education recognize daily that their classrooms contain adult learners whose ages, native languages, educational backgrounds and academic skills vary widely. Research, too, shows that students differ in the ways they learn, how fast and under what circumstances they learn, and how well they retain what they learn. Attempting to address all of these differences is one of the most daunting tasks a teacher faces. DI acknowledges this variety and addresses them along the following six dimensions (TEAL, 2010):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For instruction, teachers consider approaches to:  (1) content, (2) process, and (3) product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For learners, teachers consider their:  (4) readiness, (5) interests, and (6) learning profile&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does this mean in practice? According to Dr. Carol Ann Tomlinson, a leader in the field of DI, “In differentiated classrooms, teachers provide specific ways for each individual to learn as deeply as possible as quickly as possible, without assuming one student’s road map for learning is identical to anyone else’s”(Tomlinson, 2014). DI is &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt;, however, individualized instruction, as will be shown later.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
